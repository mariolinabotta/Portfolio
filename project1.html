  <h1 class="title_article"> Redevelopment project @Torre del Lago </h1>
  <p class="article_copy">
  The project develops in Torre del Lago Puccini, a hamlet of Viareggio known to have given hospitality to the
  composer Giacomo Puccini, who on the banks of the massaciuccoli found
  inspiration to compose his most famous works. Thanks to its location and the presence of the Natural Park of Migliarino San Rossore
  Massaciuccoli, the east-area of Torre del Lago enjoys an enviable natural setting, with the Apuan Alps as a backdrop on a flat and wide lake.

    The area, however, has been long neglected and, once abandoned the peat and sand industries, was
    abandoned. Fortunately, the administration of Viareggio has for some years
    embarked on a process of redevelopment, started with the creation of the Park of the
    Music; my project goes then to conclude this path, going to create
    a cohesion of spaces and trying to safeguard the existing ecosystem.<br>

    On the town of Torre del Lago Puccini have control a multiplicity of actors
    between Ente Parco, Regione Toscana, Provincia di Lucca and Comune di Viareggio.<br>
Regarding the planning of the part of the territory of Torre del Lago
that is in contact with the shores of the Lake of Massaciuccoli, we can
identify guidelines for actions allowed in the following instruments
main:
<ol>
  <li>The territorial plan of the Parco di Migliarino, San Rossore,
  Massaciuccoli</li>
  <li>The Northern Marsh Management Plan and the 2004 variant</li>
  <li>The extraordinary plan for Torre del Lago inside the
  new Regulation of Viareggio</li>
</ol>

  <p class="article_copy"> Starting from a landscape, historical and urban analysis, I arrived at the proposal
of a project for environmental and landscape improvement that can enhance the
better the territory and at the same time improve its usability, facilitating the routes
for slow mobility. The idea is to create functional and didactic green spaces, combining
nature and man, providing suitable spaces for socialization and leisure,
It also encourages the development of tourism not only at sea but also at cultural level.<br>

  <div style="text-align: center">

  </div>
  <p class="article_copy">
  The project consists in the creation of an urban park with the aim of
    redeveloping the area from a landscape and social point of view, heritage so far almost unused,
    and return it to the city with aâ€™identity and a public function of participation and sharing of spaces.
    To achieve such objective I have acted both on the naturalistic plan and refunctionalization
    of the existing building stock, all combined by a series of links to prevalence of slow mobility.<br>
    The complex urban park that comes to be created aims to help combat pollution, avoid abandonment of areas, promote
job creation; it is divided into functional areas, where we can find the space for relax, sport, culture and services.
The whole system works in synergy with the lake environment of Massaciuccoli and with its realization is perfectly integrated into the
territorial policies of the Regional Park.<br>
