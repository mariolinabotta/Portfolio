  <h1 class="title_article"> Multifunctional building for the industrial area "Le Bocchette" @Camaiore </h1>
  <p class="article_copy">
For this project, the first thing my work group and I have analyze the context,
an industrial area in Camaiore (LU) characterized by a Mediterranean climate because it is located very close to the sea
and protected in the north-east by a system of mountains.
We will then find cold winds coming from the north during winter, while we have warm winds coming from the southwest during the summer.

The building is oriented with long sides facing south-north.
There is therefore to the north the connection element between the two floors of the building,
the conference room and the exhibition hall, which are all spaces that do not need large amounts of light or large windows.
In the south instead we have the functions that need light and air, that is the relaxation area and the refreshment area.
On the east side is the guesthouse, while to the west we have the co-working and a hanging garden.<br></p>

 The building can be considered as a power station, because the roofing surface is entirely covered by photovoltaic panels on opaque parts
 and semi-transparent photovoltaic polycrystalline on the glazed parts.
 In addition, there is a network of rainwater that conveys rainwater and collects it in special reservoirs,
 so that it can be reused for irrigation or toilet flushing.<br>
 The ceiling, being partly glazed, during winter allows the heat of the sunlight,
 thus creating a greenhouse effect that should limit the use of heating to a minimum;
 During the summer, however, thanks to the possibility of opening mechanically some roof vents,
 in the area of distribution between the spaces that delimit the functions is created a vent stack,
 cooling the environments in a completely natural way.<br>

<p class="article_copy">
Because we are in an isolated area, our building has no obstacle against solar radiation,
so we had to pay attention in the darkening of the façades, so much so that the component of the casing becomes
the strong point of our building.<br>
To minimise thermal dispersion between the exterior and distribution environments with the interior,
we have insulated the casing of each block through a high-performance dry wall, so that during winter the accumulated heat stays
as long as possible inside, while in summer the rooms remain cool without the need to use an electric cooling system.
We have also paid attention in choosing the color of the walls, in fact the building is entirely white in order to fully reflect
the solar radiation and thus avoid the accumulation of heat especially in the summer.<br>

<p class="article_copy"> Our project is built entirely with dry elements, with the supporting structure in steel
and materials that are completely recyclable once the life cycle of the building is over.
The advantages of a dry construction system are linked to guarantees of construction time and costs,
reduced environmental impacts both during the construction phase and at the end of the building body’s useful life.
The advantages of the steel structural system are linked to the fact that there are much cleaner and better organised
construction sites than buildings built with other traditional technologies, in the case of prefabricated structures
for which the work is limited to assemblies and assemblies of construction components.<br>

  <p class="article_copy">Thanks to the mechanical characteristics of the steel profiles, moreover, structures and foundations
are obtained much lighter, with a saving of time and cost.
In addition, such a structure allowed us to cover large lights with a reduced footprint, allowing the maximum use of the covered area.<br>
In addition to the steel supporting structure, we also have OSB and plasterboard panels, and a good dose of insulation
(obtained from recycled materials such as textiles and plastics), so as to minimise thermal transmissions.<br></p>

    <p class="article_copy"> Thanks to the technological and bioclimatic choices that we have taken,
through the software MCimpianto we have been able to make the energy verification of the building polifunzionale
and such plan has turned out to be in class A+, therefore re-enters in the buildings to high energetic efficiency. <br>
