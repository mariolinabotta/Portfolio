  <h1 class="title_article"> Prototype app: ESN Florentia </h1>
  <p class="article_copy">
  The project concerns the creation of an app for the website of the association ESN florentia.<br>
  This association helps students who arrive for the erasmus in the city of Florence,
  so the target of the users is foreign students between the ages of 20 and 26.
  The app should therefore be intuitive, clear and exhaustive, as being in a new environment,
  guys are eager to seek out as much information as possible and get it as quickly as possible.<br>
  In the following image you can see three example of the wireframe I have create for some pages of the app.

  Then, I realize a hi-fi prototype because, being just a step back to the final product, it is more suitable for usability testing.<br>
    The colors used are those of the brand, the icons are taken from Flaticon while the images are taken from pixabay or events carried out personally with the association.<br>
    You can see an example in the image below, and you can test the prototype cliking on the InVision link at the end of this article.<br></p>

  Lastly, I decide to test the app with a scripted test submitted to the erasmus people who come to the office of the association. <br>
  The office of ESN Florentia is open three times a week for two hours; here the erasmus students come to book activities and have the ESNcard.
  The test helps me figure out if the service really would be useful or not, if the erasmus students are able to use the app easily
  and if its use could streamline the work in the office.<br>
  I would conduct the test in the office of ESN, during the opening hours, for about a week.
  Once the Erasmus is done with his office operations, I’d ask him if he’d be willing to lend me five minutes of his time
  to test the prototype of the app. I’ll be there observing behavior and taking notes.<br>
