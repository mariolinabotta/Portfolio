  <h1 class="title_article"> Urban regeneration of the area of the former Fruit and Vegetables Market @Lucca </h1>
  <p class="article_copy">
The project area is located at south-east of the city walls that surround the historic centre of Lucca
and hosts the old fruit and vegetable market delimited to the south by the railway line, which represents a very strong visual barrier,
and to the north by the driveway ring that surrounds the walls; lastly to the east we find the building of the former Public Butchers,
now the seat of the State Archives.

The aim of the project is to establish a consistent system with the urban structure in which it must fit and
which can be connected with intrinsic features of the city: the encounter among the development directions of the surroundings of the project area
has led to the consolidation of a system of main axes, one of which represents
the penetration axis which connects directly with the circular avenues and which then puts
in communication the project area with the old town. The other axis runs through the area in
transversal direction, combining in itself the prevailing directions oh the surrounding.<br>
The other fundamental characteristic of the intervention is the creation of a system of
squares that can be connected by both pedestrian and driveway paths,
able to represent the essence of the historical squares of Lucca outside the walls,
where today they are almost completely absent. <br>

The form that predominates in the design remains however the hemicycle one that
constitutes the fruit and vegetable market, a very strong sign in the morphology of
this area and that stands in contrast with the particular shape of the square
of the Amphitheatre, located in the historic city.<br>
The semicircular shape leads to a concentric development of the lot, in fact all
this area has been treated with predominance of the theme of the circle“”: the portico
existing was flanked to an urban plate on two levels, of which the
lower has special curved openings capable of creating permeability between
The inside and the outside; This trick allows people to discover the square by coming
from the rear front of the semicircular body and to lie in the square on which
overlook commercial activities, refreshments and parking spaces shaded.
On the plate lies a path that follows that of the porch below: this
has been articulated in three bodies, with circular pattern, which have been truncated and
rotated in three different directions to give life to a dynamic system, involving and
contemporary.<br>

<p class="article_copy"> Since the layout of the old market is at the heart of the project, the rest
keeps on sober and functional tones, going to create a system of closed
different sizes capable of hosting public and semi-public spaces of different nature.
The volumetric articulation leads to emphasize the main axes, where they are located
seven-storey and commercial buildings on the ground floor, while the rest of the
system is developed instead on a maximum height of five floors, mainly designed to
living quarters and living quarters.<br>

<p class="article_copy"> The green system has a central role in the project: the aim is to reconnect
the green ring that surrounds the walls through a system of tree-lined avenues and a
succession of squares that alternate green spaces with paved spaces.
It affects the redevelopment of the two factories that arise near the area of
project allowed to extend the green path going to create a new
urban park near the railway line. This insert try to
fencing the railway, an element that determines for a nature a break on the
territory and is usually associated with areas of degradation.<br>
